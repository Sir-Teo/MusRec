# MusRec

We want to recommend a song base from a photo.
 
## Files

- `image_scrap.ipynb` collects data from bing image and form our dataset

- `classification.ipynb` runs the model and classify images to different genres (Base on [this tutorial](https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/tutorials/images/classification.ipynb))

## What to do

- Organize the data so that it fits the model.

- Build a model that classfies images to different genres.

- Use spotify api to recommend a song base on some given genre.

- Integrate all this into a nice front end.
